# ASP-Connect-4-Minimax
Answer set programming for the connect 4 game with minimax heuristic

This project has the following keywords: ASP, connect 4 game, minimax

ASP paradigm is an application of declarative programming to find a set of possible solutions to a problem. A declarative approach uses conditions on the predicate's variables so a solution can be found.

The minimax algorithm is used in two players games, let us declare player 1 as the AI user and player 2 as the human playing against the machine. This algorithm maximizes the moves of player 1 and minimizes the moves of player 2. This is an example of Alpha-Beta prunning.

An ASP implementation of a minimax algorithm for the connect 4 game is exposed in this project. The optimization of this declarative programm is a goal for future work.
